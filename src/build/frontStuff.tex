% Abstract

\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}

Many-body systems are well known throughout physics to be hard problems to exactly solve, but much of this is folklore resulting from the lack of an analytic solution to these systems.  This thesis attempts to classify the complexity inherent in many of these systems, and give quantitative results for why the problems are hard.  In particular, we analyze the many-particle system corresponding to a multi-particle quantum walk, showing that the time evolution of such systems on a polynomial sized graph is universal for quantum computation, and thus determining how a particular state evolves is as hard as an arbitrary quantum computation.  We then analyze the ground energy properties of related systems, showing that for bosons, bounding the ground energy of the same Hamiltonian with a fixed number of particles is \QMA-complete.  Similar techniques also show that the single-particle case has related computational power.  Finally, a nice relation between spin systems and hard-core bosons can be used to show that bounding the smallest eigenvalue of the XY-model is \QMA-complete.

% Acknowledgements

\begin{center}\textbf{Acknowledgements}\end{center}

I would like to thank my advisor, Andrew Childs, for his great help and support during my graduate studies at the University of Waterloo.  His research guidance and support during hard times was very helpful, and this thesis would not be written without his support.

I would also like to thank David Gosset, who acted as a sounding board, and guided much of my research.  He was a fountain of useful ideas, with an ability to conceive of complex solutions to difficult problems.  His work ethic made many of the results in this thesis possible.

I'd like to thank Norbert L\"{u}tkenhaus, who helped get me back on my feet during troubled times, as well as Chris Pugh, who got me started and kept me going.  To all of my friends at the Institute for Quantum Computing, from the optics groups of my early years to the eclectic bunch now eating cookies at 4, thank you.
