\chapter{Universality of multi-particle scattering}


Hard, but worthwhile



\section{Multi-particle quantum walk}

Note that this is exactly what I wanted to talk about.

Very difficult in general.

\subsection{Two-particle scattering on an infinite path}

The one thing we can actually compute
It might be interesting to talk about what happens with spins.




\section{Applying an encoded $C\theta$-gate}

\subsection{Finite truncation}

Theorem 2

\subsection{Construction of $C\theta$-gate}

\section{Impossibility of some momentum switches}

\section{Universal Computation}
\subsection{Two-qubit blocks}
\subsection{Combining blocks}


\section{Improvements and Modifications}

What about long-range interactions, but where the interactions die off?
Additionally, what about error correction?
